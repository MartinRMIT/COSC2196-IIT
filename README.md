<Interest in IT>
What is my interest in IT?
  My interest in IT is currently under construction. 
  Let me explain: 
  A few years ago while I was in a deep meditative state, my focus was on the world as a whole and how humans have come to be the dominant species through millenia of technological advancement. Our fragility struck me like lightning. We are not nearly as secure as our pillars of society would like us to believe. Economy, Food, Energy, Immunity, Transport are all being juggled precariously while our foundations are shifting. 
  I asked myself, "What is something that I might be able to do or create that would lead to a better world, not just for humans, but for all living things?" Nothing short of an impossibly gargantuan effort can change the world these days right? Or perhaps it takes a few billion small and achievable efforts? All I really know is that something more must be done. We are on a rollercoaster to oblivian unless we as a species can achieve the ever diminishing prospect of perfect natural balance with nature.
  Now, you might be asking yourself "What does IT have to do with nature? Those two are hardly related" Well, you may not have given it much thought before but, our current diets, the food on the shelves that we take for granted, the fact that we aren't building our homes with our own hands, are entirely dependent on IT! They weren't previously, but they are now, and it has placed us in a position of poor food security. Our advancements in agriculture are what drove the population explosion which led to the industrial revolution which paved the way for the technological revolution. We are now sitting on the cusp of the Fourth Revolution. 
  "The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and      access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing."

  I am not naive. I understand that there are powerful industries that stand to lose vast sums of money if what I am planning becomes reality. I need brave partners.
  
Outline of my IT experience:
  Prior to my enlistment in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), my IT experience was limited to games and entertainment. I didn't even own a PC until I was 27 years old. I did own a few games consoles though, my first being the N64 with Goldeneye.
  Even though I was a high school dropout, I scored well enough above average in my RAN aptitude testing. I was offered any position that I wanted. I chose to become a Cryptologic Systems Technician. This required high aptitude for mathematics and physics as I would be dealing with technical signals (digital) sent over the radio frequency spectrum(RF). This was a specialist role, general IT was not a component. I had exposure to Linux based file systems and programs, Redhat, VMWare, and Top Secret proprietary software tools. I cannot discuss this further. 
  Since beginning my OUA studies, I have completed Introduction to Programming with Murdoch University. This has taught me the basics of C programming language. I'm now also studying Programming-1 with RMIT.
  I'm yet to build my own computer however I have made some parts replacements on my current PC, namely the PSU which I managed to blow up last year. 
  
What do I expect to learn during my studies:
  "Expect nothing and you shan't be dissappointed." That being said, I hope to receive
